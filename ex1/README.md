## Video Transaction

### Question Description

In this experiment, we are supposed to complete a video transaction. Specifically, the second video appears to under the first video through an opening circle, like a camera iris opening. Implementation effect acts as figure below.

### Experiment Procedure

In order to achieve the "camera iris" effect, there are two possible methods:

- Circle crop an image and paste it to the second one.
- Try to draw a logo layer on the canvas.
- Change original pixels to mask pixels.

#### Language and Tools

We facilitate [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to conduct our experiment.Why pyCharm? The most inviting advantage of [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is that it is an integrate IDE for [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). We are able to fluently code in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) with the help of it.

More over, combined with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), we can get any package we want. *Actually, I first tried to used openCV API to solve this question, but it's turnout to be a dead end.* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) -- Easily install 1,400+ data science packages for Python/R and manage your packages, dependencies, and environmentsâ€”all with the single click of a button. Free and open source.

Here's my [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment. As you can see, many package are listed in my env named "Video".

And the correspondences in [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

#### Algorithm Selection

In this experiment, we have tried many state-of-art ways, such as openCV. But unfortunately, as far as we are concerned, none of them show great performance in this context. Therefore, we finally choose [PIL(Python Imaging Library)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library) as our algorithm.

#### I/O Implementation

Considering that we could acquire each frame, the video imagine, and we are given the *videos* in *.jpg format, we prefer to deal with the imagines rather than the true videos for simplicity. It's very easy to transform this algorithm for videos, if really needed. 

As for output, the pictures are saved using *.png formatted. Because we can open *.png image without difficulties in [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

Input images were interpreted as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) array. The images is a [Height, Width, [R, G, B]] matrix or simply as [Height, Width, Grayscale].

```
img1 = Image.open("pics/lena.jpg").convert("L")
npImage1 = np.array(img1)
img2 = Image.open("pics/nobel.jpg").convert("L")
npImage2 = np.array(img2)
height2, width2 = img2.size
centerX = int(width2/2)
centerY = int(height2/2)
radius = int(height2/4);
```

#### Algorithm Design

By trials and errors, we finally select [PIL(Python Imaging Library)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library) as our dealer and use naive methods to change pixels' RGB.

The figure above give a brief description about the alogithm.

1. For layer image, find the rectangle interest region.
2. For each pixel in interest region, computer the distance to the center.
3. If the distance is smaller than radius, then the pixel change its pixel value to the corresponding mask image.

Core code is list as following:

```
for y in range(centerY-radius, centerY+radius):
    for x in range(centerX-radius, centerX+radius):
        if np.power((x-centerX),2)+np.power((y-centerY),2) < np.power(radius,2):
            npImage2[x][y] = npImage1[x][y]
Image.fromarray(npImage2).save('pics/circleinsertion.png')
```

**Picture Extension**

We found the insertion's size was not the same as the original one when observed in detail. As a result, we need to conduct an imagine extension.

newSize/originalSize = newX/originalX

According to this formula, we finally get the extension of the mask image. Extension is 4/3 larger than the original.

```
img3 = Image.new("L", img1.size)
npImage3 = np.array(img3)
height3, width3 = img3.size
for y in range(0, height3-1):
    for x in range(0, width3-1):
            npImage3[x][y] = npImage1[int(3*x/4), int(3*y/4)]
Image.fromarray(npImage3).save('pics/larger.png')
```

**Extension Insertion**

This step is clear when finish steps above. It's not very laborious!

```
npImage2 = np.array(img2)
radius = int(3*radius/2)
for y in range(centerY-radius, centerY+radius):
    for x in range(centerX-radius, centerX+radius):
        if np.power((x-centerX),2)+np.power((y-centerY),2) < np.power(radius,2):
            npImage2[x][y] = npImage3[x][y]
Image.fromarray(npImage2).save('pics/circleExinsertion.png')
```

### Difficulties

#### OpenCV Defects

When referring to image process, [openCV](https://opencv.org/) is always recommended as the first choice. However, we think it's unable to accommodate in this context. 

Although cv is useful in image and video process and cv almost contains many sophisticated and advanced API, it's astonishing that, *to our best knowledge*, it isn't include a simple circular image crop function!!! Cv can only crop images in a rectangle size or more complexed way (courier crop). Neither can it drop a circular image on a canvas.

Some classical answer in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31519197/python-opencv-how-to-crop-circle) actually explore this question. But we are not able to find any useful information as far, leading to the neglect of this method.

That's why we negate the first plan:

**Because I can never successfully crop images in a circle, so any efforts to paste is wasted.**

#### PIL ImageDraw Dismiss

Actually, when I try to google using keyword "python", "circle", "crop", some methods turn out to be good.

Following code is a sample:

```
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

// Open the input image as numpy array, convert to RGB
img1 = Image.open("pics/lena.jpg").convert("RGB")
npImage1 = np.array(img1)
height1, width1 = img1.size
img2 = Image.open("pics/nobel.jpg").convert("RGB")
npImage2 = np.array(img2)
height2, width2 = img2.size

// Create same size alpha layer with circle
alpha1 = Image.new('L', img1.size, 0)
draw1 = ImageDraw.Draw(alpha1)
draw1.pieslice([height1/4, width1/4, 3*height1/4, 3*width1/4], 0, 360, fill = 255)
alpha2 = Image.new('L', img2.size, 0)
draw2 = ImageDraw.Draw(alpha2)
draw2.pieslice([0, 0, height2, width2], 0, 360, fill = 255)

// Convert alpha Image to numpy array
npAlpha1 = np.array(alpha1)
npAlpha2 = np.array(alpha2)

// Add alpha layer to RGB
npImage1 = np.dstack((npImage1, npAlpha1))
npImage2 = np.dstack((npImage2, npAlpha2))

// Save with alpha
Image.fromarray(npImage1).save('pics/croppedLena.png')
Image.fromarray(npImage2).save('pics/croppedNobel.png')
```

No bad, right?

But there exists some difficulties when trying to paste. In fact, the layer part **is not transparent** but some interesting RGB, so you can not simply paste it to the layer.

That's why we negate the second plan:

**Because I could not paste an ImageDraw to another image.**
